# PC_Builder_3100
Academic Project under the course CSE 3100

This is an academic project where I built a PC Builder.
This enables you to add latest hardwares with the prices, and you can add the hardwares together that are needed to build a PC. 
This will work as a guide for people confused with building PC.
